# Contributing NGF Automation Content

Contributions to this repository are welcome!

If you want to contribute, please follow the usual github approach: Fork the repository, prepare your changes in a branch and open a Pull Request towards our repository, into the **master** branch.

In all instances, please follow these guidelines:

- Put all user-contributed content into the `contrib/` subdirectory only. Pull Requests touching files outside that directory will be rejected.
- Create a separate subdirectory for your templates.
- A `README.md` file describing your template inside the directory would be very helpful. At the very least, please indicate which versions of the NextGen Firewall you target (if there are any specific version requirements).

Thanks!
